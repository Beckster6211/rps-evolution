          On School of Code there is something called hackathons (these usually
          occur Fridays). The point of these to take what we have been
          shown/taught during the week and put it into practice building
          something that uses those skills. The first hackathon we were given
          was to create a rock paper scissors game.
          <br />
          <br />
          This task was to help with using basic HTML and vanilla JS üç¶. It
          focused on dom manipulation to display the relevate information. We
          also had to use functions to generate the computers random move. As
          well as statements to monitor the scoring generating a response when
          got to a specific number and the ability to add your name.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is the game that managed to create, although it is not in its
          truest form (4 1/2 days coding experience). As the original hackathon
          the game only worked in the console not as part of the screen ü§î.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the task with creating the game was dom manipulation and I have
          tinkered with it since finishing the first week to make it so that it
          does display the relevant information on the screen üìä.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the other tasks added to it since week 1 is having alerts and
          prompts for adding the players name which I also added at a later date
          üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
